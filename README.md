PylosAI
=======

An AI bot for a board game called Pylos, written as an 3rd year assessment piece in a Bachelor of Computer Science at UWA.

The code works, but I wouldn't recommend trying to play it for fun. The user interface needs some work (the UI wasn't part of the assignment).

For a description of the game itself have a look at the [assignment description](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS4211/Project/12/assignment.html) or the [wikipedia page on the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylos_(board_game)).
