PylosAI
=======

An AI bot for a board game called Pylos

The code works, but I would recommend trying to play a game of it for fun. The user interface needs some work.

For a description of the game have a look at the assignment description at on UWA's website or the wikipedia page

I wrote this bot as an assessment item for course I did at the University of Western Australia
